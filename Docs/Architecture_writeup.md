Documentation:
We have included two diagrams for the purpose of illustrating our architecture. Our frontend has a hierarchical OOP approach, where each class contains multiple component classes that are then combined together and hooked up to various database functions. This is demonstrated in our UML diagram, which we chose to be a UML class diagram because we felt it best represented how we chose to architect our program, and there was no specified way of making a UML diagram given. Our program uses a custom asynchronous API, where requests are made in functions that look like on_{user input event}(), and the retrieved and processed data is sent to functions that look like on_{data received}(). This is demonstrated in the layered diagram by dotted two sided arrows between the user input, async worker, and database. In the layered diagram, the dotted arrows represent asynchronous events and the solid white arrows represent the hierarchy we created.
